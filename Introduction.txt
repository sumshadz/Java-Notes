Basic Structure of java programc:

--> Every valid Java Application must have a class definition that matches the filename (class name and file name should be same).
--> The main method must be inside the class definition. i.e. public static void main(String[] args)
--> The compiler executes the codes starting from the main function.

This is a valid Java program that does nothing.

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
    }
}

Java JDK, JRE and JVM :

What is JVM?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.


Why is Java platform independent?
Java is a platform-independent language. It's because when you write Java code, it's ultimately written for JVM but not your physical machine (computer). Since JVM 
executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is platform-independent.
